    "#### **Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some note on getting the MP Select Mini up an running on a test print:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Date:** 1 January 2021\n",
    "\n",
    "As of this date, the printer was at firmware version \"v30.50B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the manual, page 7, \"SETUP\":\n",
    "1. Move the extruder to the home position.\n",
    "2. Adjust the bed height in quarter turns until a piece of paper snuggly fits between the bed and the head.\n",
    "3. Use the \"move\" menu to lift the extruder above the bed ~3 cm.\n",
    "4. Once happy with bed height, preheat the extruder and bed (I used 195 C for extruder and 60 C for bed).\n",
    "5. If not already inserted, insert the filament into the printer until you cannot push anymore.\n",
    "6. Wait for extruder to heat up and then use the \"move\" menu to increment the filament until some emerges, then wait for it to stop coming out and clean the extruder with a plastic scrape tool.\n",
    "7. Print the \"cat.gcode\" test print and pause it after 2 layers have been laid down to inspect the layers. Watch to make sure that the first layer adheres to the bed. It seems normal for the first ~1 cm of the print to be thin or have a \"tail\" (I guess they didn't put a \"purge wipe\" in the gcode for this test print?). If you don't like this, you can manually advance the extruder with the \"move\" menu before starting the print and then clean the extruder with a plastic scrape tool right before it starts to print. After a few tries, I was able to have the print start fairly cleanly.\n",
    "8. If the layers are too squished, lower the bed height by an eighth of a turn, reprint, pause, and examine the layers. If the layers are not straight, but wobbly, lift the bed height by an eighth of a turn, reprint, pause, and examine the layers.\n",
    "9. When happy with the bed height, print the \"cat.gcode\". It takes 3 hours and looks like this:\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/print.gif\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some defects in this print. Notably, there seemed to be a diagonal tilt to the print bed, so I spent 30 minutes carefully adjusting the height of the print bed. Then I restarted the \"cat.gcode\" print and left it overnight. In the morning, I was able to compare the first and second prints:\n",
    "\n",

    "</div>\n",

    "Much better."

    "#### **Installing Cura and Repetier**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Cura**\n",
    "This is software that parses 3D model files and \"slices\" them into the tool paths needed for the printer to print them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of Cura that ships with the printer is quite old (https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/releases/tag/15.04.2). Instead, I installed the latest version from Ultimaker's website (Ultimaker Cura 4.8): https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, Cura started up and walked me through:\n",
    "1. Account creation.\n",
    "2. Setting up the MP Select Mini as a known printer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I opened the \"cat.gcode\" file and played around with Cura a bit. Neat.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Repetier**\n",
    "This is similar software to Cura and I opted not to install it at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Updating the firmware**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't do it. From everything I can find digging around online, the version of the firmware on this printer (\"v30.50B\") is the latest and cannot be updated using any of the \"newer\" firmware. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Checking Current Calibration Values**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Serial monitor (I'm using the one built into the Arduino IDE), we can send G-code \"M503\" to see what the current calibration values are in the printer (see: https://mpselectmini.com/extruder_calibration):\n",
