    "Building an antenna mount so that I can mount the rabbit ears antenna that I use for my piaware setup outside on the fence.\n",

    "\n",
    "I used OpenSCAD to build the 3D model of the antenna mount. The fence slats are ~2cm thick and the part of the antenna that I want the mount to hold is ~4 cm wide, ~2cm deep and ~2cm tall, with a stem that is ~1.7cm thick.\n",
    "\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/3D_model.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the model is on it's side, so that it's easier to print! We'll need some supports in the screw holes and in the stem gap, but that's a lot less filament wasted in this position than if we oriented it any other way. I could have broken it into pieces that can be glued together, but I decided not to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum thickness of the walls of the mount is 4 mm. The screw holes are 3 mm diameter in the mount and 4mm in the top plate that will cover the mount. The saddle of the mount will overhang the fence by 46mm, with a width of 50mm. Next, the model was exported to an STL file and sliced it with CURA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CURA**\n",
    "\n",
    "The STL was sliced using 0.175mm layer height, 75% infill with a line pattern, and 190 C extuder temperature. Also set z-hopping with extraction and auto-generated supports with a brim for better bed adhesion."
