    "The main clip is larger than what the monoprix can print, so I had to split the print up into 2 parts. I clipped it using Fusion 360.\n",

    "The STL was sliced using 0.175mm layer height, 100% infill with a line pattern, and 190 C extuder temperature. Also set z-hopping with extraction and auto-generated supports with a brim for better bed adhesion."

    "\n",
    "1. the latching mechanism on the end is too rigid and difficult to engage, so I supplemented it with a twist tie\n",
    "2. the screw insert doesn't engage enough with the clip, so screwing on the cap causes the insert to spin\n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to fix #2 by scoring the insert and clip with a knife to give it some teeth. I also added some beeswax to the where the insert interfaces with the coffee bag and that helped too.\n",
    "\n",
    "But ultimately, I ended up trying another design."

The STL was sliced using 0.13125mm layer height, 10% infill with a grid pattern, and 200 C extuder temperature. Also set z-hopping with extraction and auto-generated supports with a brim for better bed adhesion."
