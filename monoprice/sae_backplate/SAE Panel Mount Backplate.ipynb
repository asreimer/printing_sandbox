    "Building a backplate for an SAE panel mount connector for a solar powered battery box. The walls of the battery box are a bit thin and flexible, so the backplate is intended to provide some stiffening and support for the panel mount when plugging and unplugging the panel mount connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **OpenSCAD**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used OpenSCAD to build the 3D model of the backplate. The panel mount has 4 holes spaced 25 mm apart. It also has a central circular shaped bit where the wires extend from with radius of approximately 1 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the front of the panel mount connector looks like:\n",

    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the dimensions, here's the 3D model I came up with:\n",

    "<div>\n",
    "<img src=\"images/3D_model.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The backplate is 4 mm thick, 70 mm radius cylinder. The holes are 2 mm diameter. Next, the model was exported to an STL file and sliced it with CURA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **CURA**\n",
    "\n",
    "The STL was sliced using 0.175mm layer height, 100% infill with a line pattern, and 200 C extuder temperature for good layer adhesion."
