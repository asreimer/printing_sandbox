# Summary

Peg design for the Cribbage board.

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: Prusa
Printer: Prusa Clone
Rafts: No
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2

Notes: 
I used 2mm brim as it's foot print very small

# Post-Printing

After removing brim, there were some scartchy edges. I rubbed them against ordinary print paper and that smoothed edges quite nicely.

# How I Designed This

At work during lunch we play game of crib a lot. One of the green pegs was missing for long long time and we were using another blue one, which was causing confusion. I finally decided that was enough, spent 20 minutes designing and hour and a half printing several versions. Posting latest design.
On the pictures, red and blue pegs are original, black one is 3D printed.
